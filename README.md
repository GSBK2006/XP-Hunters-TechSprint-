# 🌙 Midnight Feast AI  
### Biological Kitchen Intelligence  

**Transforming Food Waste into Gourmet Experiences with Multimodal AI**

Midnight Feast is a high-fidelity kitchen management **MVP** designed to bridge the gap between  
**“what’s in the fridge”** and **“what’s for dinner.”**

Built for the modern, sustainable home, it uses **computer vision and multimodal AI** to not just *see* food — but to analyze its **biological condition**, predict waste, and guide users toward smarter, zero-waste cooking decisions.

## 🔗 Live MVP Demo
👉 **https://midnight-feast.netlify.app/**

> *This is a functional MVP showcasing the core Waste-First intelligence, biological scanning workflow, and zero-waste recipe logic.*

---

## 🚀 Core Innovation: The *Waste-First Engine*

Most recipe apps ask:
> *“What do you want to eat?”*

**Midnight Feast asks:**
> *“What do you need to eat — before it’s wasted?”*

This reversal of logic makes sustainability the default outcome, not an afterthought.

---

## 🧠 The “Impossible Recipe” Solver

When traditional recipe apps fail, Midnight Feast activates **Survival Gourmet Mode**.

### 🔧 Scrappy Reasoning
Even with minimal ingredients:
- A single onion + condiment →  
  *Balsamic Onion Reduction*  
  *Deconstructed Scrappy Snack*

The AI never returns *“No results found.”*

### 🔗 Ingredient Bridging
- Identifies **one missing item** that unlocks **multiple meals**
- Converts an “empty fridge” crisis into a **strategic micro-shopping list**

---

## 🔄 Core User Workflow

### 1️⃣ The 10-Second Biological Scan
Powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**, the system performs deep visual analysis:

- **Object Detection**  
  Identifies multiple raw and packaged ingredients simultaneously
- **Biological Condition Analysis**  
  Detects ripeness, browning, wilting, and texture changes
- **OCR Expiry Extraction**  
  Reads *Best Before / EXP* dates directly from packaging

---

### 2️⃣ Forensic Review Phase
Before recipes are generated, users verify AI understanding:

- **Spotted Items** – Everything the AI detected
- **Condition Sync** – Estimated remaining shelf life  
  *(e.g., “Wilting • 1 day left”)*
- **Manual Correction** – Remove ghost items or add missed ones

This ensures the AI “Chef” works with **accurate reality**, not assumptions.

## 🛠 Feature Modules

### 🧊 Biological Pantry
A persistent digital twin of your physical fridge.

- 🔴 **Red** – 0–2 days remaining (Critical Risk)
- 🟡 **Yellow** – 3–4 days remaining (Warning)
- 🟢 **Green** – 5+ days remaining (Fresh)

Items persist until cooked or deleted.

---

### 🔔 Waste Risk Alerts
Proactive alerts for ingredients with **≤ 3 days remaining**.

- **One-Tap “Cook This Now”**
- Forces the Recipe Engine to build a dish around the expiring item

---

### 🍳 Zero-Waste Recipe Engine
The AI Chef operates under a **Waste-First Mandate**:

- **Shelf-Life Prioritization**
- **Ingredient Risk Sorting**
- **AI-Generated Dish Visuals**  
  (Professional-grade food imagery to reduce takeout temptation)

---

## 📈 Impact Mathematics

Impact is **calculated, not guessed**.

- **Impact Points**  
50 + (Detected Items × 20) + Vibe Multiplier
  - **Waste Reduced (kg)**  
Sum of average biological weights saved  
*(e.g., Tomato = 0.2kg)*
- **Sustainability Score**  
(Total Impact ÷ Log Entries) × Efficiency Factor

---

## 🛡 Safety & Personalization

- **Critical Allergy Lock**  
Hard-coded exclusions (e.g., peanuts are never suggested if flagged)
- **Dark Mode**  
High-contrast UI optimized for late-night cooking sessions

---

## 💻 Technical Specifications

- **Intelligence Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025`
- **Imaging Model:** `imagen-4.0-generate-001`
- **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage (Zero-Database MVP)
- **Camera Access:** Secure `getUserMedia` API (HTTPS required)

## 🌱 Vision

Midnight Feast is not just a recipe app —  
it is a **biological awareness system** for the kitchen.

Built with ❤️ for a **Zero-Waste Future**.
